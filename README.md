First react based web application

https://NomadicVampire.github.io/Todo-List Visit this site to view this web app

This react app basically a web app in which user can add or delete todo item in their list and stores it in their local storage.
This app uses concept of react router to jump from one page to another without page being reloaded that makes user expereince more better.
I have added all source codes with as possible as many comments in code for explaining that part of code exluding node_modules folder(due to complex size). Hope it helps :)
