 <!-- Todo list using react -->

This react app basically a web app in which user can add or delete todo item in their list and stores it in their local storage.
This app uses concept of react router to jump from one page to another without page being reloaded that makes user expereince more better.
I have added as possible as many comments in my code for explaining that part of code. Hope it helps :)
